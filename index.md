This project focued on solving a problem that myself and a lot of my fellow students 
had when learning about algorithms: understanding what they _looked_ like. In order to 
solve this issue, I built this tool with a group in order to visualize what common 
array sorting techniques visually looked like, as well as what paths common traversal algorithms
took on an arbitrary graph.
