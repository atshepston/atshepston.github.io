**Tech**: Vue, Typescript
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/atshepston/Data-Visualization-App)

This project focued on solving a problem that myself and a lot of my fellow students 
had when learning about algorithms: understanding what they _looked_ like. In order to 
solve this issue, I built this tool with a group in order to visualize what common 
array sorting techniques visually looked like, as well as what paths common traversal algorithms
took on an arbitrary graph.

## Local Face Recognition on a Raspberry Pi

**Tech**: Python, Tensorflow
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/atshepston/ECE535-Smart-Doorbell)

Smart doorbells can sometimes depend heavily on cloud infrastructure, which can introduce latency, privacy concerns, and higher costs. By deploying ML systems on a Raspberry Pi in real-world settings we can achieve real-time detection, address privacy concerns and, and lower costs.

## ServiceSignal

**Tech**: Python, FastAPI, Postgres, Docker
**Link**: [Github Repo](https://github.com/atshepston/ServiceSignal)

ServiceSignal is a app aimed at making keeping track of vehicle maintenance easier. Once you input your vehicle and service records, ServiceSignal will alert you when regular maintenance is needed, for any common replacable.

**Tech**: C, PCB Design


Designed and built a miniaturized temperature-sensing device powered by an ATtiny85 microcontroller, including a custom PCB optimized for strict size and power constraints. Developed ultra-low-power embedded firmware in C using duty-cycling and watchdog timers to extend battery life. Added a clear, user-friendly OLED interface with selectable °F/°C readout.
